# Video_Steganography_for_Copyright_Protection
This project is based on Steganography, created as a part of Course: Data Compression and Encryption 

In this Project, we tried exploring steganography in
various forms. We first did image hidden in another image, then
we managed to hide text in an image. We then decided to use this
new found knowledge of hiding a message to Video Copyrighting
by embedding a unique code for each user in the video so that
the pirate of a video can be tracked by identifying the code from
the pirated video.
